# FinWise – Gamified Financial Literacy Platform (Demo)

This is a prototype landing page for FinWise – an AI-powered, gamified platform that teaches financial literacy to children aged 10–18 in the UAE.

Built using **Streamlit**, this app is hosted on **Streamlit Cloud** and demonstrates:
- A homepage with background visuals and click-based navigation
- Future-ready placeholder sections for parent dashboards and teacher toolkits

## Run Locally

pip install streamlit
streamlit run app.py
